# Customer-Feedback

This is for a customer review asking a previously serviced client to make a quick evaluation of the process.

The customer (user) picks a rating and types a review of the service received. 

It includes a mock-end server using db.json as its database.

Full dev that can run GET, POST, PUT and DELETE.

Please send me a message to report any bugs.

> git clone https://github.com/aldrintm/Customer-Feedback.git

> npm i

Check package.json to run scripts

Ideally you'd want to run the mock-end and the ui concurrently. 

> npm run dev
